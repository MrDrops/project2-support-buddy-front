# Getting Started with Support Buddy

Support Buddy is an app that is designed to help users develop routines and habits. 

The app has three primary functions:

1. Gather information about the user;

2. POST/GET user information via database; and

3. Communicate/send notifications to users in an encouraging and friendly way.

## GATHER USER INFO

We have two methods to source user info.

1. Users are required to choose an activity upon registering.
-- this allows us to understand what kind of notifications and recommendations to present to the user

2. Users are required to complete a brief survey based on the activity they selected
-- this provides us with some insight into the user's physical health, age, access to facilities, etc.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
